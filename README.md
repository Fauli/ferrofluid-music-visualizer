# DIY Ferrofluid Display with Music-Responsive Coil Project

## Introduction
This project guide will walk you through creating a ferrofluid display. The display reacts to music using a coil with a ferrite core, controlled by a simple LED light controller. The ferrofluid is housed in a clear, flat bottle, creating an interactive visual spectacle that dances to the rhythm of your favorite tunes.

## Materials List
- Ferrofluid
- Clear, flat bottle
- Alcohol and distilled water (for the ferrofluid suspension)
- Coil with a ferrite core
- [SUPERNIGHT LED RGB Strip New TQ Music 2 Touch Controller](/images/TQ-MUSIC-2-RF-Controller.jpg)
- Jack plug (for feeding music into the controller)
- Wiring and connectors

## Tools Required
- Soldering iron and solder (for connecting wires)
- Funnel and measuring tools (for preparing the ferrofluid mixture)

## Construction Guide

### Step 1: Preparing the Ferrofluid Mixture
Mix the ferrofluid with alcohol and distilled water in the desired ratio. Carefully pour the mixture into the clear, flat bottle using a funnel to avoid spills.
